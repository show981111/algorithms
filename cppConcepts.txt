In C++, static members don't belong to the instances of class. 
they don't increase size of instances and class even by 1 bit! 
They don't incease size of derived class too

Vtable is a static member. All class instance has one virtual pointer
that points to Vtable! No matter how many virtual functions do we have,
only one virtual pointer! so just add 8byte to each class instance!
