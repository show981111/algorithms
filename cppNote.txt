lValue vs rValue
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbYknr-HPYE&ab_channel=TheCherno
    rValue => something that is "temporary", something that is not able to be assigned a value
    lValue => something that has a location in Memory. it is possible to get value assigned.

    int getValue() => returns rValue  => so getValue() = 5 (X)
    int& getValue() => returns lValue => getValue() = 5 (O)
    lValue reference : setValue(string& x);
    rValue reference : setValue(string&& x);

Move 
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehMg6zvXuMY&ab_channel=TheCherno 
    https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/move 
    std::move() => make something rvalue(T&&)[temporary]
    So it just becomes a temporary object like 10 7 "asdas"... 
    If that value is moved, it becomes empty...
    string x = "hello";
    string y = move(x); 
    => x is empty, y is "hello", when "hello" is moved from x, x's pointer is set to nullptr!
    and the actual data that pointer refers to is moved to y's pointer 
    if we do not use move, then x = "hello", y = "hello"

CPP NOTES
    Class design
        (copy constructor, destrurtor, = operator overloading)!!
        with default constructor + (move constructor and move = operator overloading)

VECTOR
    .erase(pos) => erase the element at "pos", .erase(end()) is undefined! behavior
    .erase(from, last) => erase [from , last), O(last-from)
        from and last should be defined! 
    RETURNS : 
        Iterator "following" the last removed element!
        If pos refers to the last element, then the end() iterator is returned.
        If last==end() prior to removal, then the updated end() iterator is returned.
        If [first, last) is an empty range, then last is returned.
    .back() returns reference. So we can do v.back() = 7 (it will change!)
    .insert(pos, val) or
    .insert(pos, iter.begin, iter.end)
        Insert elements right before the pos

Priority Queue<item, container, compare>
    Compare class should overload () operator
        bool operator(){const T& a, const T& b}{
            return // ex) a < b;
        }
    For priority queue, our heap is contained in an Array.
    It makes heap by Compare(parent, cur) == true : swap(par, cur)
    So, if Compare returns parent < cur (usually ascending oreder),
    then it makes maxHeap by making biggest elem to the root! 
    Then when it pop, swap(data[0], data.back()), then fixDown(0).
    Thus, the order is reversed from when we are using a sort().

Function Type in CPP == similar to function pointer but more readable
    function<R (...args)>
    => function<Return Type (params)> No comma between R and (...args)!
    Example)
        unordered_map<string, function<int (int, int) > > map = {
            { "+" , [] (int a, int b) { return a + b; } },
            { "-" , [] (int a, int b) { return a - b; } },
            { "*" , [] (int a, int b) { return a * b; } },
            { "/" , [] (int a, int b) { return a / b; } }
        };

Function Pointers
    int (*fcnPtr)();
    fcnPtr is a function pointer that Takes no argument and retuns int. 
    We can do fcnPtr = &foo; foo is a function name

Optional
    optional<T> someValue;
    if(somaValue.has_value()) ... 
    This is used to differentiate empty(no value) with other values.
    It is good for initializing or giving a default!

CPP vector erase() and clear()
    Time complexity is O(N)!!
    pop_back() is O(1)

lower_bound(begin, end, val , [comparator for "<"])
    - comp(elem, val) = false 인 첫번째 아이템 (elem >= val 인 첫 아이템)
        (elem < val)
    ex) low = lower_bound (v.begin(), v.end(), 20, 
            [](const int& elem, const int& val){
                return elem <= val;
        }); 
        This makes lower_bound like an upper_bound
        (will return the first elem such that !(elem <= val), which means elem > val )
upper_bound(begin, end, val , [comparator for "<"])
    - comp(val, elem) = true 인 첫번쨰 아이템  (elem > val 인 첫 아이템)
        (val < elem)
    ex)  auto it = upper_bound(mp[key].begin(), mp[key].end(), timestamp, 
                                [](const int &val, const pair<int, string > &a){
            return val < a.first;
        });
    
    Getting the last element such that a < b => use Upper bound, and decrement the index!!
    * Upper_bound gets the first element such that val < elem
    * lower_bound gets the first element such that val <= elem

std::list(Doubly Linked List)
    https://cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/?kw=list 
    push to front and back, popping from front and back are constants.
    If we now the position of element to erase,
    list.erase(pos) => constant! 
        This is the key difference from vector and deque
            => vector and deque should shift elements, so erase by position takes Linear
    Cannot use std::sort(begin, end, Compare), use std::list.sort(Compare)

Be careful with type conversion! (int, size_t ,double) => division and subtraction!
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    (x + y) /2 => returns int because int is divided (1)
    (double)(x + y) /2 => returns Double because double is divided(1.5)
    (double)((small.top() + big.top()) / 2) => returns double but incorrect (1) becaue int is divided,
    so the result is 1 then 1 is converted to double, so it returns 1. 

Vector Equality (== operator)
    if content is same? then true, else false
