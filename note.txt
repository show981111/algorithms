Two Pointers(start, end)
    Usually used when the array is sorted. 
    Finding a target by narrowing down the range from the [start, end].
    
    #Format
        while(start <= end)
            if(something) // Found the answer
                return result;
            else if 
                start++;
            else 
                end--;
    
DFS
    Find constraint satisfaction paths or routes.
        -> sometimes go backward from destination and checking all paths as a successful path.
            ex) 130. 

Sliding Window
    [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8] (SIZE : N)
    {A B C}             (SIZE : M)
      {A B C}
        {A B C}
    Time complexity : O(MN) => O(N) possible
    When moving a Window, there are duplicate calculation(the indices that are redundant)
    So, just -previous starting point + previous SUM + current end = current window's result .
    Just update the result by subtrating and adding an offset
    EX) Algo1-567
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6
    v v v => func(0) + func(1) + func(2) = prevSum
      v v v => preSum - func(0) + func(3) = prevSum
        v v v => preSum - func(1) + func(4) = prevSum ... on & on
